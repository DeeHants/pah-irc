        <p style="margin-right: 75px">Perpetually Against Humanity is an <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"><abbr
        title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr></a> game based upon the card
        game <a href="https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/">Cards Against
        Humanityâ„¢</a>, but designed to be played over a long period of time
        (forever) with a changeable group of people.</p>

        <h2 id="cah">Cards Against Humanity</h2>
        <p>Cards Against Humanity is:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A trademark of Cards Against Humanity LLC;
            their content is licensed under a <a
            href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">Creative

            This project is otherwise completely unrelated to Cards Against
            Humanity and is not endorsed by Cards Against Humanity LLC.</li>

            <li>A party game for horrendous people. In order to win you pretty
            much have to construct outrageous politically incorrect plays. If
            that is likely to upset you then you won't like the IRC version
            either.</li>

            <li>A great game which is much more fun in person than any IRC
            version can ever be, so if you like this then <a
            href="https://store.cardsagainsthumanity.com/">you should definitely
            buy it</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="playdocs">Player Documentation</h2>
        <p>This page is aimed at people who are wanting to <i>play</i>
        Perpetually Against Humanity (PAH).</p>

        <p class="rightnow">You can play right now by joining us in <a
        href="irc://chat.freenode.net/#pah">##pah</a> on <a
        href="https://freenode.net/">Freenode</a>.</p>

        <p>If you're wanting to
        <i>install it</i> in order to run your own then please refer to <a
        href="https://github.com/grifferz/pah-irc">the GitHub
        repository</a> for downloads and full instructions.</p>

        <p>Throughout this documentation we will assume that:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The bot's IRC nickname is <span class="p_a_h">P_A_H</span>
            (which is what it is on Freenode). If you're playing in someone
            else's game then it will be a different nickname.</li>

            <li>The channel we're playing in is <span class="chan"><a
            href="irc://chat.freenode.net/#pah">##pah</a></span> (which is one
            of the channels on Freenode). If you see the bot in a different
            channel then just use that one.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This section covers all the commands you will need to use to play
        the game. See the <a href="#complete">Complete List of Commands</a> for
        a few more commands that may be useful.</p>

        <h3 id="basic">Basic rules</h3>
        <p>It's very much like <a
        href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/cah/CAH_Rules.pdf">Cards Against
        Humanity</a>. If you aren't familiar with Cards Against Humanity,
        however, this is how it goes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>There's a Black Card with some text on it.</li>
            <li>Each player has ten White Cards, each of which have an answer
            on them.</li>
            <li>Players choose which White Card(s) they think will go with the
            Black card to make the funniest play.</li>
            <li>One player is called the Card Tsar; they do not get to play a
            White Card. Instead they get to pick the funniest play once
            everyone else has made their play.</li>
            <li>Whoever was responsible for the funniest play wins one Awesome
            Point.</li>
            <li>Someone else becomes Card Tsar, everyone's hands are topped
            back up to ten White Cards, and a new Black Card is drawn.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There's <a href="doc/logs.html">some logs of a real game</a> to give
        you more of an idea.</p>

        <p>This game is meant to be played <i>slowly</i>, while you are on IRC
        anyway. If you want a real-time IRC game of Cards Against Humnaity then
        you should run one of the many bots that already exist for this, or <a
        href="https://github.com/grifferz/pah-irc">download your own copy of
        PAH</a> and <a href="#faq_faster">configure it for quick games</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="joining">Joining an existing game</h3>
        <p>Use the <span class="cmd">deal me in</span> command in the
        channel:</p>

        <table class="chanlog">
            <tr>
                <td class="ts">16:28:17</td>

        <h3 id="seehand">Seeing your hand</h3>

            <p>Play the numbered White Card for this round. Some rounds require
            two White Cards, so they will be played in the order specified.</p>
            <p>The bot will repeat back to you the current Black Card and your

            <p>You may alter your play as many times as you like until every
            active player has made their play, at which point the plays will be
            revealed to the channel and may not be changed.</p>
            <p>Where a channel will not be required, just saying one or two
            numbers (without the "play" prefix) is an acceptable shortcut.</p>

                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>If you would prefer for the bot to use a different pronoun in
            relation to you, use this command to set it. This will apply in all
            games that you are in.</p>

            <h3 id="gloss_black">Black Card</h3>
            <div>
                <p>There's one Black Card per round, which everone sees. It
                will have zero, one or two blank spaces on it which players
                fill by choosing from their White Cards. If the Black Card has
                zero blanks then there's an implicit blank right at the
                end.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 id="gloss_white">White Card</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Each player has ten White Cards at all times. Also called
                answer cards. White Cards are chosen to fill in the blanks on
                the Black Cards.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 id="gloss_round">Round</h3>
            <div>
                <p>A round starts when a new Black Card is drawn, proceeds
                while all players make their play, and ends when the Card Tsar
                picks the funniest play. The winner then gets one Awesome
                Point.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 id="gloss_tsar">Card Tsar</h3>
            <div>
                <p>One player is the Card Tsar. The Card Tsar does not play
                White Cards. Instead, the Card Tsar chooses which play is the
                funniest.</p>
                <p>A different player becomes Card Tsar at the start of the
                next round.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 id="gloss_point">Awesome Point</h3>
            <div>
                <p>You get an Awesome Point when you win. Go you, you're

            <h3 id="gloss_winner">Winner</h3>
            <div>
                <p>The player whose play is chosen as funniest by the Card Tsar

            <div>
                <p>A set of Black Cards and White Cards, often on a particular
                theme. One or more packs form a deck.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 id="gloss_pack">Deck</h3>
            <div>
                <p>The game's Black and White Cards are drawn randomly from the
                deck. A deck is made from one or more packs.</p>
                <p>As of version v0.5 all games must use the same deck. There's
                <a href="https://github.com/grifferz/pah-irc/issues/100">an
                open issue to have a unique deck per game</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div id="faq_accordion">
            <h3 id="faq_ownchan">Can I have this in my own channel?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Yes! Just <span class="cmd">/invite</span> the bot to your
                channel. <span class="cmd">/kick</span> it out again to make it
                go away.</p>
                <p>On Freenode the bot is called <span
                class="p_a_h">P_A_H</span>.</p>
                <p>On Blitzed the bot is called <span
                class="againsthumanity">AgainstHumanity</span>.</p>
                <p>You'll be stuck with certain bot-wide configurations when
                you use someone else's bot. As of version v0.5 these include
                things like the <span class="cfg">turnclock</span> and the
                selection of card packs. If you want for those settings to be
                different then you'll need to <a href="#faq_runown">run your
                own bot</a>.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 id="faq_runown">Can I run this myself?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Yes! Download it from <a
                href="https://github.com/grifferz/pah-irc">the GitHub
                repository</a>. You'll need Perl and SQLite and the ability to
                install some Perl modules.</p>
            </div>
            <h3 id="faq_lagged">Why is the bot sometimes so lagged?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>The bot rate limits its own messages so it doesn't get
                flooded off.</p>
                <p>The bot sends a lot of text, and if it didn't rate limit
                itself then the IRC daemon would fairly quickly start applying
                anti-flood measures to it. You know that's happening because
                some messages just don't arrive. Eventually the IRC daemon
                disconnects the boot for flooding.</p>
                <p>This can get a little confusing when the bot is saying
                things in the channel but appears to not be responding to
                commands you type in private to it. It actually has responded,
                but just hasn't got around to sending that message to you
                yet.</p>
                <p>Please just be patient and the bot will eventually get
                through it all.</p>
                <p>We're working on finding out how far we can push things. We
                know that having the bot voiced in the channel "helps" but
                don't know specifically how much. As of version v0.5 the bot
                sends a burst of 10 messages at one per 0.2seconds and then
                after that one per second until it hasn't sent any for a while
                again.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 id="faq_faster">Can the game be played faster?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>This game is designed to be slow so you can play it while
                you do whatever else it is you do while you're on IRC. So, if
                you're not the one running the bot then chances are you're
                using a bot configured with a <span
                class="cfg">turnclock</span> of several days. This is set on
                purpose so that everyone playing can, if necessary, take
                several days to do their duty.</p>
                <p>If you <a href="#faq_runown">run your own bot</a> then you
                can have a faster game by setting a much shorter <span
                class="cfg">turnclock</span>, such as 1 hour. This works
                well; in fact that was how we tested this bot in the first
                days. The game will go as fast as the slowest player present.
                The main problem with it is that you need to do the work to get
                people all together at once and ready to play.</p>
                <p>If no one is making the effort to organise play times then
                the natural asynchronous nature of IRC will eventually mean
                that you can't get a quorum of four players in the same place
                at the same time within one hour, and your game will never
                proceed.</p>
                <p>That's why we run with a big <span
                class="cfg">turnclock</span>: to make it work on IRC as a
                background activity with no need to organise.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 id="faq_status">Can the bot be made to regularly tell me the
                game status?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>In short, no: it's not necessary.</p>
                <p>Players new to this game are often not used to the idea of
                playing a game that mostly involves waiting for other people to
                do things. This is understandable; the traditional concept of
                <i>playing a game</i> tends to conjure up images of people
                together doing things in real time.</p>
                <p>PAH is not like that. PAH is more like a play by mail sort
                of thing. It's asynchronous and event-driven, the events being
                the players taking their actions. Like IRC itself.</p>
                <p>But it's the urge to "play this game now, come on, <i>play
                it</i>," that leads people to ask</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><i>What's happening?</i></p>
                    <p><i>What's happening?</i></p>
                    <p><i>What's happening?</i></p>
                    <p><i>What's happening <b>now</b>?</i></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>You can of course periodically use the <a
                href="#privcmd_status"><span class="cmd">status</span></a>
                command in private to interrogate the bot about the status of
                the game. And so, people concerned with <i>just what is going
                on here?</i> ask for the bot to regularly spew out a status
                update without them having to ask for one.</p>
                <p>Relax. Go about your serious IRC business. You were on IRC
                before this game existed. Continue doing that, whatever it
                was.</p>
                <p>In fact the bot <i>does</i> inform you periodically of what
                is going on, it's just that it informs you only when something
                has actually happened. Repeatedly giving you information you
                already have would be unwelcome to most people, so you most
                likely do not <i>really</i> want a regular status update.</p>
                <p>That is not to say that further features designed to gently
                encourage players who need to take their turn to do so would
                not be welcome, because they would. If they make sense and are
                compatible with the idea of not being hassled until you need to
                be hassled.. Please <a
                href="https://github.com/grifferz/pah-irc/issues">submit an
                issue</a>!</p>
            </div>

            <h3 id="faq_quitirc">If I quit IRC will it resign me automatically?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>No. Asking to be resigned or being forcibly resigned due to
                timeout are the only ways.</p>
                <p>This is intentional so that people are able to quit IRC (or
                get disconnected), some back and carry on playing. Apart from
                doing your duty, the only thing you need to do is idle in the
                channel.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 id="faq_notice">IRC bots should use NOTICE! Why doesn't this
                use NOTICE!?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>I know, I know. I'm a big believer in bots using NOTICE even
                though it seems to have fallen out of fashion these days. All
                my <a href="https://github.com/dgl/TwitFolk">other</a> <a
                href="https://github.com/bitfolk/enoch">bots</a> try to use
                NOTICE exclusively.</p>
                <p>So why not PAH? It's because it relies on the hilight
                feature of your IRC client to notify you when you need to do
                something, and hilights (in irssi) don't work in NOTICEs.</p>
                <p>There's <a
                href="https://github.com/grifferz/pah-irc/issues/50">an issue
                open</a> that asks for a mode where extra private messages in
                place of channel messages that would hilight people, and all
                other channel messags to be NOTICEs. It hasn't been tried yet,
                but it will be eventually, if people are still playing this
                game.</p>
